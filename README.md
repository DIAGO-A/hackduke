## Inspiration
Since our world had totally converted into online mode also with our college and schools, online taking of notes form the live classes of zoom,youtube,gmeet is like really difficult, so I thought of making a smart notebook that can automatically take down our notes using the super cool api of ASSEMBLY AI.
## What it does
It can take note of the online lectures, video, or anything that we want to note and after taking down the whole note we can also print the note.

The most import thing is that this app can work on any smartphone as well as in our comupeter!
## How we built it
I had built using Assembly AI and implemented the whole thing in the Node-red to handle the each and every operation of the API and the voice input.
## Challenges we ran into
1. To stream the audio over the node red.
2. TO use the realtime api of the Assembly AI
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I had came up with the result in this short time some what I wanted and thought of making it.
## What we learned
1. Realtime API use of Assembly AI
2.Use different HTTP node in the node red.
3.Streaming audio in the node red.
